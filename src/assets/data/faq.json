            "question": "What is Trekking?",
            "answer": "When at home this activity is called backpacking. When you find yourself halfway around the world, this traditional way of traveling long distances on trails is called Trekking. A trek is a journey. A journey through a different country and culture. In the days of the British Raj, these treks were a way to explore vast areas of previously unexplored territory and could last months or even years."

            "answer": "The nature of these trips is such that most treks will go up to altitudes many of us have never been before. However, this is not something to be overly concerned about. Our treks are designed to allow for a proper progression of acclimatization as we gain altitude during the trip. Many people will experience a slight headache due to dehydration at first, but with proper hydration this small discomfort is short lived."
